"Okay, so who exactly is playing all these ""hidden object"" games??","I don't have as much time for gaming as I used to so lately I've been getting into the dreaded casual gaming genre. There are some really cool tycoon type sims, and even a few snazzy rpg/strategy titles which would have slipped by my radar, but the sheer volume of these ""hog""s is staggering. Now, I don't have anything against hidden object games, I've even played a few, but how did they become so wildly popular? The first hidden object game I remember seeing was a couple years ago. Now there's a new one every week, and I can barely find anyone who knows what they are, much less anyone who plays them enough to justify so many new titles.

Am I missing something, or are these things just so cheap to make that they've started some kind of weird hidden object game mill?",gaming
Nora Wall Sex Abuse Case.  Need some information!,"I didn't know where else to turn. I'm desperate!

I am researching the Nora Wall Case for a class concerning miscarriages of justice. I thought this would be a perfect case but through much research I have found little to no information about the actual trial testimony or court documents. 

The wikipedia article lead me to some good newspaper articles. I went to my school's archive for some of these articles, but much of the information doesn't really refer to the actual testimony. 
I would also like to learn more about the judge in the case, Judge Carney and the Lead Prosecutor Denis Vaughan Buckley. 

I know that there was also an RTE segment about her on ""Would You Believe"" in 2000. I have tried contacting the Central Criminal Court in Dublin and have received no response. I would really appreciate some help from anyone who has access to court documents or other information.",ireland

Lost my gf/best friend for good. I really would just like someone to talk to.,"It wasn't losing a girlfriend that hurt as much as it was my best friend. I had a lot of issues getting close to people and she finally broke down that wall. A year and a half later I found out she had cheated on me seven months in. She had changed by then, I was broken hearted but kept pushing to try and get back what I thought we had. That was a mistake, I should have walked away instead of prolonging the suffering. I'm using the usual advice now but it hurts losing the person you trusted so deeply and seeing that they don't feel the same way you do. I feel pathetic and lonely. I have such a hard time reaching out for help with my friends and family so I figured I'd start here. Does anyone want to get to know me? Maybe give me a pep talk or hear my deepest darkest secrets? Please ask if there's anything you want to know that can help you help me. I'm not thinking straight enough to put everything together myself.",relationship_advice

How I ruined it with a great girl.,"I´m drunk. I hope you are too, r/drunk.


Well anyways, first: I'm sorry for grammar-fails. English is not my first language, and I'm drunk so it's even harder for me to write in good english. but I just discovered firefox got spelling-corrections, so I'll probably spell like a boss.


I met a girl tonight. We've talked for maybe.. 2 months. We go in the same school, a high-school. We see each-other every now and then, we hug and small-talk, cold-talk.
""How are you?""
""Good, and you?""
""It's alright""
""Okay, see you later""
""ye""


Shit like that. Our first conversations (via facebook) was awesome. We had so much in common. Just stuff that we both thought exactly the same about. Then we met for real. She was on a party in my town (she lives in a nearby city) and wanted to see me. I grabbed some beers and headed to see her. We talked and I thought I did pretty okay. The day after I thought she became pretty passive, boring. 


I asked her if something was up, she said that she only wanted to be friends. I laughed it away.


""haha only if I don't become a gay-friend ;)""


and she laughed, haha ofcourse not. 


I had alot of female-friends, sadly. I didn´t want another, I wanted her for real. But ofcourse, I hid behind a mask.

SHE was the one who was the person of us that was ""on"", she wanted to meet, she wanted something real. She knew how I looked like, we've talked before that time when we met for real. I have no fucking idea what I did to put her off.

Fastforward a few weeks. 


We talk similar to how we did in the beginning. 
Right after she said she only wanted to be friends, she didn´t wrote kisses och hearts after saying goodnight, which was pretty heartbreaking. But now we did. She asked me every now and then if I was going to be home on the weekend, yes I said.


""There's a risk that I'll drunken-call you and want to meet you""


""Haha, okay, it's fine""


Well we met tonight, she was on a party, she texted me and said that she and my friend wanted to see me. I grabbed some beers and walked to them. She seemed more interesting about him than me. I joined the party, said hello on everyone I knew, people I haven't seen for ages. All I wanted was to talk to her. She was pretty busy with talking to everyone else, so I said fuck it and walked out in the cold. I went to a big swing, laid down, put on some music on my cellphone, wondering whether to text her or not. I KNEW I would regret it tomorrow. 


I texted her anyways. About how I couldn't stay just friends with her, I wasn´t searching for another female-friend, I wanted more from her. 


She just texted me saying ""i like you, but just as a friend, and if you can´t be just friends with me you're not the person I thought you were""


What the fuck's that supposed to mean? 


I should probably end with something like ""open the door, get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur"" but it´s  true, and this fucking sucks.


I'm sorry for writing something this meaningless and ordinary. Sorry if you took your time and got dissapointed.


This story doesn´t even have an end, wtf am I doing?

Just for a change of pace here's a good cop story.,"Had a little run in with the boys in blue a couple weeks back and it was actually pretty awesome.

I live in an old hotel converted to apartments, it still has the bar and restaurant downstairs. Some friends played a show after which we always hang out and party it up. This time someone had mushrooms so we went for a little ride. All went well most of the night until one of the band members got up to take a leak and hit the deck. He came around pretty quickly but went back out again then went from pale to blueish. We asked what else he had taken but his friends didn't know. Morons. I told one of the guys to call 911. Before anyone got there the guy was on his feet and had his color back so they headed back to their hotel room. When the cops got there the situation sunk in and I got a bit light headed myself, so after I answered the door I sat down to get my bearings. The officer was amazingly nice and polite, he said the medics were still on the way even though the passer outter was gone, so they were going to check me out just to be sure. Then he said something I will never forget, ""Look, we aren't here to arrest anyone who took illegal drugs, we just want to be sure everyone is ok."" Holy shit balls!! The medics came and took my blood pressure, then they all left to find the other guy. 

I decided those guys were no longer allowed to party at my place, I'm no longer the wild child these guys are and I don't want anyone dying in my house. The hotel decided the same thing since they destroyed their comped rooms. Childish.

So yeah, not all the cops are evil power trip ass holes. Some are still out there who really do want to protect and serve. It's good to know so I figured I should share.",Drugs

"My first e-cig arrived Wednesday. So far, so good!","My kit came Wednesday. I charged it up and haven't smoked a cigarette since. When I have a craving, I smoke my eGo-T and it satisfies my craving. I can definitely see myself never smoking another real cigarette. 

Pros:
1) Easy to charge and assemble.
2) The starter kit came with plenty of items. My wife is using the other e-cig that came in the kit and she hasn't smoked a real cig since Wednesday either.
3) Vaped all evening Wednesday, all day Thursday, and most of today before I charged the battery. It wasn't even dead today, but I thought I had better charge it anyway.
4) No stink.
5) No ash.
6) I can smoke it in the house.

Cons:
1)I miss being able to let the cigarette dangle from my lips while I type, work, or when I am doing anything with both hands.
2)I'm not fond of the juice I ordered. It hits my throat entirely to hard and leaves a burning sensation on my tongue. I should have some new juice arriving tomorrow. (Does anyone know if the amount of nicotine in the juice effects the throat hit and the tongue burn? I really don't like that feeling.)

Organizing props. Database?,"I am trying to figure out the best way to organize props for film/tv productions. I'd also like to keep it as basic, accessible, and shareable  as possible, so ideally it would be done with Google Docs somehow.

So far, I've just used spreadsheets/tables with obvious columns (category, prop, scene, notes, etc.), but the problem arises when trying to sort that data in different ways. Basically, a single prop may be used in multiple scenes, multiple props may be in a single scene, props in one category might come from multiple suppliers or the other way around, and so on. Obviously, I don't want a list like 1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3 when sorting by scenes, and when calculating costs or work, I don't want to see props listed more than once.

What is the best way to do this? How can I display alternate views of data that can have hierarchies going in multiple directions, and is it possible without leaving the spreadsheet world? Is this the job for a database, and if so, is there something that works like Google Docs?",AskReddit

Need Advice On Summer Trousers,"I think I know what to do, but here is my situation:

I am going to Europe for about 3 weeks in June, it will be warm. I am not going to go over to Europe and stick out like a sore thumb by being the American jackass wearing shorts. I *think* the style there is light linen trousers in summer. What I really want from you guys is a list of what to bring to fit into a more European style (and hopefully stuff that will just look good on me in general). I also intend to go swimming in the mediterranean while I am there, but I don't know the fashion styles there for trunks/water wear.

Here are the catches:

 1. I am ONLY bringing a carry on suitcase and a messenger bag style backpack.
 2. I am still losing a lot of weight. Currently 220 and headed down to 180. As a result, none of my clothes fit me very well anymore, I need to go get my suits tailored, I know, but the point I am trying to make here is that I would prefer to spend less right now so that when I get to my goal weight I can spend more. 

I live in NYC, so if that modifies any specific advice please feel free.

How to make sex happen when I want it to happen with my girlfriend?,"We have been dating for 2 years, have sex on a regular basis. I can't remember last time we did something outside the bed. Blowjobs only happen in the context of sex, which usually only happens at night. 

I think about sex all day long when I am with her, but for some reason I always wait hours for the ""perfect"" moment to initiate.

Whenever we do have sex, we never say ""lets go have sex"". We just start making out and it goes from there. I have never said ""I want to have sex right now"" or ""Can you give me a blowjob right now"" or anything like that.

I don't know if its because I just never have before or if I just don't expect her to comply. I always imagine being like ""hey lets fuck right here, right now"" and her reaction being one of disgust or something like ""woahhhh now, calm down""

HELP! ....Cluster-Fuck @ Formating New WD 2TB disk using Windows. What do?,"Earlier today I posted this


Following the suggestion to use { Control Panel -&gt; Administrator Tools -&gt; Computer Manager [Storage -&gt; Disc Management] }  I tried twice today to format the disk without success. The results were the same each time.


The “progress bar” stopped moving both times “just a hair” past half-way to my eye... Of course there is no numerical indicator of where you are : / 

After waiting a good while each time, I canceled out of the format routine. If I then look at the disk “Properties” all seems well and I’m told the “this disk is working properly”

However if I try to Explore the disk, Open the disk or copy files to the disk I get a “Drive not Available” error message. The drive is clearly not formatted. I just don't know why it isn't or what to do.

The system would not perform a ""Quick format"" (if that's even possible with a new disk). Both attempts were using the ""standard"" format with default settings.

Any help guys?

**EDIT 1** I just ran the Western Digital Data LifeGuard Diagnostics and it terminated saying ""too many bad sectors found"" (or something like that). Does this mean I bought a bad disk or could the ""bad sectors' be from the formatting routine? 


**EDIT 2** *Not my day for changing hard drives : /* ...So on everyone's recommendation I exchanged the drive this morning. Brought the **second one** home and the computer couldn't recognize the disk at all.. FUUUUUuuuuuuuuu.... Put my known-good disk back in just to be sure and there was no problem.

Intro: 21/F/5'6/110lbs (April 1-June 24),"Before

When I came to college I lost the freshmen 15 without trying or wanting to. Now I am starting a career in healthcare and I have found my size to be a problem. My goal is to get stronger in the next 3 months to where I can help move patients around without needing to ask male coworkers for help. Another goal that goes hand in hand with this is to fit back into my clothes from high school (size 2-3, I like the way I feel and look better at this size) and gain muscle tone. Plan: work out 5x a week focusing on 1-2 major muscle groups per day (ie. back, legs, chest, etc). I have started and stopped probably 2-3 times already this year and I will do it this time!

edit: my post was confusing. I stopped dancing when I started college and because of inactivity I lost muscle mass and therefore lost weight. I do not really care about gaining weight or not, but it is inevitable if i gain muscle i will gain weight.",BTFC

My husband and I are thinking about starting this program, but cost is a bit prohibitive right now. How much did you sink into equipment when you first started, and what did you buy? What would be the minimum I could purchase for the two of us to work out together? I'd rather get dumbbells over bands, as I noticed a lot of people say they don't work very well. What starting weights would I need for a skinny Asian guy who never works out and a chunky girl who has been doing a very mild weight training program with 5 and 10 lb dumbbells (and who just gave birth)?

I also had a possibly dumb question for any p90x new moms out there... I'm currently in my third trimester and plan on breastfeeding. Will this affect my ability to breastfeed (working out too hard) if I start this program once the baby is born, or is that a silly fear? Has anyone had actual experience with this?",P90X

I think Somer Blink is an elaborate scam.,"I've been watching Somer Blink for the past couple of weeks and I've had a strong suspicion of foul play. Things just don't add up. A lot of the same people win over and over, beating the odds many times in a row. 



For isntance I just took this screenshot. This guy won the majority of the blinks in a 20 minute period, and as you can see he only buys like 20% of the spots. He won 8/12 blinks, and his bids were all around 20-25% of the spots. The probability of that happening is very low.



In fact if you calculate the betting odds, theoritically you should be negative in the long run, yet many people have allegedly made billions and continue to do so. 


Could it be that Somer Blink is not random and is giving wins to their own toons? Think about it. they already make like 20-100m per blink from the profit of payments - cost of the ship/item, but if they decide who wins and picks their own toons, it all looks legit but they're not actually giving away that ship because they themselves won it.

Of course they let legit players win often, if not most of the time, and I'm sure there are legit people winning billions by sheer chance, because otherwise no one would play/ 

That's just my theory. There's no way to prove it without actually hacking into the site or whoever runs it or something like that so it's just a conspiracy theory I suppose.

EDIT: More strangeness in Somer Blink. People bidding more than the ships are worth?

"Alright Canadian Redditors, let's each bring a first-time voter to vote on election day.","Let's do this. For all of us who are serial voters, let's each team up with someone in our area and bring them to a voting place.

In order to do this, we need to start now. If there is a new voter who wants to vote, post your riding and closest major intersection in the comments. If you're a long-time voter, do the same and hopefully we can each PM (OMGWTFBBQ! PM stands for so many things!) each other and we can help a new voter see how easy it is to get their vote on.

Maybe we can even help the new voters get on the voters' list, or if they're not on the list by election day, we can help them go through the painless process of registering at the polling place.

And just so no one goes downvoting or trolling and saying that this is some sort of political party trying to get out the vote, I don't care who you vote for. NDP, Bloc, Conservative, Liberal, Green, Flying Monkey, Booger Stealer, whatever party you want to vote for, lets help new voters get to the voting place and vote.

Tutorial for Lisp and Java coder?,"Hello,

This year I'm in two programming classes. One is a very laid-back class where we just write games. The other is an independent study where I'm learning Lisp. I've been learning Common Lisp, and just finished a pretty involved project involving the genetic generation of a tic-tac-toe AI. So I'm far from being an expert Lisper, but I do feel comfortable with the language.

Additionally, I've been coding Java for the past few years. Last summer I started a job as a Java dev with a local tech company (it was less exciting than it sounds, but was still a fantastic experience for a high schooler, IMHO). So I'm pretty aware of the language and especially the API/stdlib.

Back to my classes--I just finished a PyGame game, and now it's time to start a new project. If I used Python (or even Java) again, I'd feel obligated to make something really awesome, but I'm just kind of worn out about it and don't want to. Instead, I was thinking it might be a good opportunity to learn Clojure, which I've been interested in--but previously I haven't been able to justify learning it (it seemed more important to either do more work and get paid, or learn more Common Lisp). So I'm thinking it'd be reasonable to make something relatively simple (*Space Invaders* spinoff?) as an applet.

I'm assuming that since I know a Lisp and a JVM language, learning a JVM Lisp will be relatively easy--and I don't really want to use a tutorial that teaches how to program, but rather just the specifics of Clojure itself. Something like *Learn Python in 10 minutes*.

So does anyone have any suggestions? Any other general tips? Also...what's the most straightforward way to set up SLIME with both SBCL and Clojure?

Thanks in advance.

"IAMA european living in Mexico (Queretaro state), ask me anything","Im from north west europe, I'll keep my native country out for privacy. I moved to Mexico when I was 25, been living here now for over 8 years. Married to a beautiful Mexican girl :) Ask me (almost) anything!

People are very catholic here. You'll find jesus and (more) the virgin of guadelupe in about every corner, every bus, every taxi, etc.. some taxi's have no safety belts, no seats, no breaks, but they do have a phrase ""I only need god to save me""... Anyone who has ever been in a taxi here knows that even god might not be enough..

Mexican food (read: real mexican food, not tacobell crap) is an aquired taste, first year much of it would make me nauseous just thinking about it, right now I could not live without it.

Mexicans have a strange definition of  ""spicy"".. If you are foreigner, and they say its just a liiiitle hot, take it as you will burn in hell while eating, while processing, and while on the bathroom :)

As in many countries, the gap between rich and poor is large. Being from north west europe, this took *a lot* of getting used to.

Common attitude here is ""fuck the rules!"" which can be bad, but also good. Where I lived, rules would suffocate you, here in Mexico you are pretty much free to do as pleased. Gives lots of opportunities, but can also get you killed if you are not carefull

Mexican engineering is.. well, as they say themselve.. ""The mexican way!"".. its.. interresting..

Current problems with drug gangs is mostly, thankfully, far away for me. With some exceptions, mostly only see it on the news, happening in the north. 

Anything else? ask me!
Mexico is not bad, just more extreme then I'm used to. People are mostly either great, or plain assholes. Money earned is either a small fortune, or a sad joke, etc..

Worst thing? Immigration.. Things I've seen there are incredible.. Officers ridiculing and laughing at people, bribery right in front of you.. though things have improved in the last few years..

TL;DR: Mexico is just another country, I guess.. It has its problems, but its my home :)

Sawk facestomped the dark type, only taking damage from Liepard's astonish, we then rolled over the fighting type, this time he had a rocky helmet on so the last pokemon would kill itself (damn sturdy)

Then I switched to zweilous for the psychic type, only took damage from the sigilyph's ice beam, and completely dominated the ghost types.

Team for N
Zekrom downed Reshiram, and did some damage to vanilluxe before fainting, sawk cleared the rest of the team with no problem


Team For Ghetis
Zekrom was able to kill cophagrigus, but not before being hit by toxic, he only had 8 hp left, so i switched to sawk... who again dominated

The only other thing thats ever caused me to throw up (other than being sick or drunk) was a story a buddy told me. Who knows if its true or not, but it disgusted me beyond belief. I'll give you the short version... Basically he described a great behemoth of an obese lady. Rolls large enough to house hobos. Thighs that did not seperate, etc.. Apparently she was so large that she could not leave her house, bed ridden etc.. 

So She was devouring, hoarfing, collapsing upon a hoagie during 3rd lunch. Part of this Hoagie fell off, and got lost somewhere upon her mammoth body. As she shifted and wiggled it became wedged between two of her fat rolls. Over time the Meat in this portion began to rot, and she eventually developed a sore because of it. It got so bad that had to come in and freight her to a hospital. Oozing, blood, puss, sweat, etc.. Just the way he described it to me that day made me lose it....

Just turn a Post-It note sideways and cut a line in between each task.  Some of you may find this stupid, but it helps me concentrate more on just 1 task specifically, and prevents me from being lazy and pulling a *look-at-all-the-work-i've-done-i-guess-i-can-take-a-break-now*.",GetMotivated
This girl might be using me. Help me out reddit!,"So i started talking to this girl in college, my age(18). We really like each other, and weve been making out and going on ""dates"". We recently had sex, but when i asked her if she wanted to be in a relationship, she replied with ""i dont know"". Help me out reddit, should i stick around and see if anything develops or should i start putting distance between us? Im so confused.
*Edit* Thank you guys so much for your comments and clearing my head up a bit. I guess time will tell, thanks again!",relationships
"Getting a 3DS, need help with games.","So in the next couple of days I will be getting my hand on a 3DS. My problem is that I haven't owned a handheld of any sort since the days of the GBA, so I really don't know what to look for when it comes to good games. Is there anything out there that you could recommend picking up? Thanks in advance!",gaming
Hey Reddit! What is the best April fool's day prank you have seen or done to someone?,"We've heard the worst pranks, so let's hear the best! Right now myself and another friend of mine have changed our facebook names and photos to Rebecca Black, and are trolling everyone we know. I also have a friend who became Admiral Ackbar and is now going around telling everyone ""It's a Trap!"".

My friends and I recently finished a project we were working on. Would love your feedback on all aspects of the site,"Hi All,

So a couple of friends and I decided to work on a site over the past few weeks. We finally put it up this morning and I was hoping to get a little feedback on how I could improve the design and flow of everything.

If there're things you would like changed, feel free to let me know and we'll do our best to implement it asap!

Is it an inside joke for venue workers to play awful music between bands?,"It seems every single time I have gone to a concert the interlude music while preparing for the next band is awful and completely unrelated. At a metal concert? Have some rap between bands. Electronic music? Hope you enjoy John Mayer while you wait.

I am convinced that this has to be done on purpose. Have any of you ever worked at a concert venue in charge of the house music?",AskReddit
Wyeast 3711 French Saison STILL fermenting,"So I decided to brew my first saison and heard that this strain is easier to use that the Belgian. Brewed it almost a month ago and it is still fermenting (bubble every 2 minutes or so). I'm going to finally take a gravity reading tonight, and with an OG of 1060, I'm hoping that I have created an alcohol monster. Admittedly, I live in Portland, OR and it's not exactly springlike, so it's been fermenting at 66-70 in my living room and I know that saison is supposed to ferment warmer, but I was just curious if anyone else has had similar experience with this yeast.",Homebrewing
